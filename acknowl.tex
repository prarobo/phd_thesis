First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor Dr. Herbert Tanner, for his patience and valuable guidance throughout my PhD. The knowledge and systematic outlook he instilled in me, was instrumental in enabling me to finish this dissertation. I would also like to thank members of my PhD committee: Dr. Ioannis Poulakakis, 
Dr. Christopher Rasmussen, Dr. Guoquan Huang, Dr. Arthur Trembanis and Dr. Sunil Agarwal for their comments and advise that helped me channel my dissertation in the right direction.

I would like to thank members of \gls{cshel} at University of Delaware for the helping me with data that was utilized in this disseration. It was a great pleasure learning the way of life in Sea from them (even though I got sea sick the first time I was on a ship). I would like to thank Dr. Art Trembanis for allowing me to use the scallop data collected during his research projects and for opening to me the facilities in College of Earth and Ocean sciences to support my experiments. Special thanks to Hunter Brown, lab manager at \gls{rdl} for providing me access to test facilities in Lewis, Delaware. I would like to mention my thanks to Justin H. Walker for providing me the annotated scallop data which was critical to my experiments. Thanks to Carter DuVal for building with me my first unsuccessful scrappy \gls{rov}. The \gls{rov} building painfully continued a few years before getting to the point of a working prototype. Thanks also to other graduate students of Matthew Oliver and Mark Moline who provided support during experiments at Lewis. Special thanks to Scott Gallager and Amber York of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution for sharing the datasets on which Matthew Dawkings and Charles Stewart of RPIâ€™s Computer Science Department worked on. The building of CoopROV took a lot of lives, in this case, apart from mine, I would like to thank undergraduate interns Yehan Zhang, Yang Liu and Austin Crouse for their willing sacrifice.

Thanks to all the funding agencies \gls{nsf}, \gls{arl} and \gls{nih} that graciously supported my work over the years through grants \gls{nsf} RI \#0913015, \gls{nsf} CPS \#1035577, \gls{nsf} EAGER \#1548149, \gls{nih} \#R01HD087133 and \gls{arl} MAST CTA \#W911NF-08-2-0004.

Thanks to all my lab mates for stimulating discussions and support through out this PhD, with special mention to Jie Fu, Shridhar Shah, Luis Valbuena Reyes, Aditya Boddu, Konstantinos Karydis, Jianxin Sun and Adam Stager. Thanks also to all other university faculty, staff and fellow students who had assisted me in various ways.

Finally thanks to my father A.S. Kannappan, mother PL Meenakshi and brother K. Priyadharshan for their relentless moral support throughout this PhD. Thanks to my girlfriend Karthika Ramanathan for motivating me get through this dissertation.
