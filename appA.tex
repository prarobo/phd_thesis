\appendix{Title of Appendix}

This is the information for the first appendix, Appendix A. Copy the base file, appA.tex, for each additional appendix needed such as appB.tex, appC.tex, etc. Modify the main base file to include each additional appendix file.

If there is only one appendix, then modify the main file to only use app.tex instead of appA.tex.
